# Dev Env
### Vagrant CentOS7 Development Environment  

A little bit nicerer than my last attempt.  
This uses ansible to just install the tools then runs a ```post_install.sh``` script to do some config for some of the apps.

### Whats Inside
(main stuff)  
* Golang 1.5
* Chruby
* Ruby 2.1.3
* Git
* Zsh
* Vim

### What I want
* Docker (not sure yet though)
